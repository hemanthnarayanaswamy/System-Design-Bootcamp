# <center> CAP Theorem</center>

CAP stands for **Consistency**, **Availability**, and **Partition Tolerance**, and the theorem states that:
`It is impossible for a distributed data store to simultaneously provide all three guarantees.`

* **Consistency (C)**: Every read receives the most recent write or an error.
* **Availability (A)**: Every request (read or write) receives a non-error response, without guarantee that it contains the most recent write.
* **Partition Tolerance (P)**: The system continues to operate despite an arbitrary number of messages being dropped (or delayed) by the network between nodes.
